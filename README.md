# **üìå Practical CV Techniques and Applications**  

This repository is a **comprehensive guide** to Computer Vision techniques, covering both **theoretical insights** and **practical implementations**. It includes hands-on exercises for **image processing, feature extraction, object detection, segmentation, and deep learning-based models**.  

## **üìÇ Contents & Concepts**  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Image Processing & Transformations**  
- **Grayscale Conversion:** Simplifies images by removing color, focusing on intensity.  
- **Brightness & Contrast Adjustments:** Modify pixel values to enhance image visibility.  
- **Arithmetic & Logical Operations:**  
  - **Addition & Subtraction:** Blends or highlights differences between images.  
  - **Multiplication:** Enhances contrast.  
  - **Bitwise Operations (AND, OR, XOR, NOT):** Used for masking, merging, and extracting image regions.  
- **Flipping & Rotations:**  
  - Horizontal, Vertical, and Both-axis flips.  
  - Rotations by 90¬∞, 180¬∞, and 270¬∞ for orientation changes.  
- **Image Concatenation:** Combining multiple processed images horizontally or vertically.  

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Extraction: HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients)**  
- **Concept:** Extracts edge and gradient information to detect objects efficiently.  
- **How It Works:**  
  - Computes **gradients** in an image.  
  - Divides image into **cells** and calculates **histograms of gradient directions**.  
  - Normalizes across **blocks** for better accuracy.  
  - Used in **object detection (e.g., pedestrian detection)** and **ML classifiers**.  

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Image Acquisition & Video Processing**  
- **Capturing Images & Videos via Webcam:** Using OpenCV for real-time image acquisition.  
- **Reading & Displaying Videos:** Frame-by-frame video processing.  
- **Saving Captured Images:** Storing frames as images for further processing.  

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Object Detection & Recognition** *(Future Scope)*  
- **Feature-based techniques (HOG, SIFT, SURF)**  
- **Deep Learning models (CNNs, YOLO, Faster R-CNN)**  
- **Segmentation techniques (Thresholding, Watershed, Mask R-CNN)**
