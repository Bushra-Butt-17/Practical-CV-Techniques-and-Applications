# üìå Image Processing and Computer Vision Basics

A Python-based repository for fundamental **image processing** and **computer vision** techniques. This repository covers key operations such as **image representation, transformations, filtering, feature extraction, and visualization**, using libraries like OpenCV, NumPy, and PIL.

## ‚ú® Core Concepts  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Image Representation & Manipulation  
Images in **computer vision** are stored as **arrays of pixel values**. This repository covers:
- **Loading images** using OpenCV, PIL, and Matplotlib.
- **Accessing pixel values** (RGB/BGR representations).
- **Modifying images** (color changes, drawing shapes).
- **Resizing images** using interpolation techniques (nearest-neighbor, bilinear, bicubic).

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Image Filtering & Enhancement  
**Filtering** is crucial for improving image quality and extracting important details:
- **Noise Reduction** using Gaussian, Median, and Bilateral filters.
- **Sharpening** using convolution operations.
- **Edge Detection** using Sobel, Prewitt, and Canny filters.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Extraction & Visualization  
Feature extraction helps identify **patterns and structures** in an image:
- **Histogram Analysis**: Understanding pixel intensity distributions.
- **Color Space Conversions**: Converting images to **grayscale, HSV, LAB** for different processing needs.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Image Reading & Writing  
This repository covers multiple methods to **load, display, and save images**:
- **Using OpenCV (`cv2.imread()` and `cv2.imwrite()`)**
- **Using PIL (`Image.open()` and `Image.save()`)**
- **Using Matplotlib (`plt.imread()` and `plt.imshow()`)**

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Image Statistics & Histograms  
Histograms provide a graphical representation of pixel intensities:
- **Grayscale image histograms** (single-channel intensity distribution).
- **Color histograms** (separate R, G, B distributions).
- **Cumulative distribution functions (CDFs)** to adjust contrast.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Image Transformations  
Transforming an image allows manipulation for better analysis:
- **Geometric transformations** (scaling, rotating, flipping).
- **Affine transformations** (translation, shearing, warping).
- **Perspective transformation** (removing distortions).

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Grayscale & Color Conversions  
Color models are used to represent images differently for various tasks:
- **Grayscale conversion (`cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)`)**
- **HSV & LAB color spaces for better color-based filtering**
- **Thresholding techniques for binarization**
